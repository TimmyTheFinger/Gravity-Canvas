# Gravity-Canvas
## Lewis Menelaws 2024 Hackathon Submission

Hello, thanks for checking out my submission for the Lewis Menlaws 2024 Hackathon. The topic was ***ðŸš¨FUNCTIONALLY DYSFUNCTIONALðŸš¨***

<details>
  <summary>So what IS the Dysfunctional part of the function...yyy thing?</summary>
The dysfunctional part of my submission is that the canvas's drawings are affected by gravity.

### How to Use

To use this hackathon submission, follow the steps below:

1. Just install the files as a zip and unzip it. This does not need an internet connection to run, nor any third party libraries installed!

2. Open main.html, but this is not necessary. You can just open index.html which takes you straight to the Canvas

3. That's all really, enjoy drawing! 

## Tools I used

- Figma
- ChatGPT (**ONLY FOR BRAIN STORMING, LAYOUT PLAN HOW TO MAKE THIS AND ADDING COMMENTS SINCE I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED. I WANTED TO CHALLENGE MYSELF AND DID NOT WANT TO USE AI AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAMMING**)
- So many YouTube videos
- Javascript documentation

Thanks again Lewis for making this Hackathon. I'll be honest I had zero clue who you are and why I am in your discord but this was fun :)
